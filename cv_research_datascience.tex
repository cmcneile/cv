\subsection{Research plans in data science}

I have started a project on extracting the geometry of the eye using
MRI scans of a patient. The ultimate aim of the research is to develop
evidence based treatments of Myopia. I work on the data analysis and
we have preliminary results from the work done by an Undergraduate
student working on a summer internship.  This project is done in
collaboration with researchers in Optometry in the School of Health
Professions, and the director of the Brain Image Research Center at
the University of Plymouth. I co-supervise a PhD student in the
School of Health Professions. See

for a
summary of the project.


I am working with a collaborator to build machine learning models to
predict customer churn in the Telecom industry.  The goal is to
incorporate natural language processing techniques, such as topic
modelling, to the classifiers.  This research is done in collaboration
with BT research, and I am co-supervising a PhD student on the
project.  This is a spin off from various MSc projects I have
supervised.  The project has produced a refereed paper in the
proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Statistics: Theory
and Applications (ICSTAâ€™23). We are planning of developing an
REF impact case from this research.
