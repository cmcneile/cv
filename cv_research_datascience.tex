\subsection{Research plans in data science}

I am working with a collaborator to build machine learning
models to predict customer churn in the Telecom industry.
The goal is to incorporate natural language processing techniques,
such as topic modeling, to the classifiers.
This research is done in collaboration with BT research.
This is a spin off from the MSc projects I have supervised.
