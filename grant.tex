\section{Grant writing experience} 

I am the PI for  a new lecturer grant from STFC. I am
a co-pi for a grant held by Swansea and Plymouth.

While I have been working  at University of Plymouth, I have been
the PI on one grant of computer time from Dirac, and I have been
co-PI on to other grants of computer time.
In 2009, 2010, 2011
and 2012,
I wrote successful applications for computer time at the Julich
supercomputer center in Germany. I have been the PI on two projects.

In February 2007, I was involved in writing a successful proposal to
EPSRC for postdocs for computational work.  At the start of 2007 I
worked on UKQCD's bid for supercomputer resources for all lattice QCD
in the UK (Dirac-I). The grant was of the order of 6 million
pounds. The grant was approved by the funding agency, however because
of budget problems the money was only released late in 2009, after I
had left the UK.


While working in the US,
I worked with the MILC collaboration in writing grants for
substantial amounts of computer time from various NSF supercomputer
centres. In 1996, I helped to write a successful proposal for the
renewal of the MILC collaboration's status as a grand challenge
computational group from the US Department of Energy.
