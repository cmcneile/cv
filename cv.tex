\section{Teaching experience}

\subsection{My experience in lecturing}


\begin{description}

 \item[University of Plymouth, 
Software Development and Databases,
2 years]\hfill \\ This is a 20 credit module taught in
MSc program Data Science and Business Analytics. This is a conversion
MSc, so many students have no prior experience with programming.

  \item[University of Plymouth, Operational Research and Monte Carlo Methods,
9 years] \hfill \\
This course is taught to  30 to 70 students over a semester. The course is fully
assessed via courework. I started teaching the students with the statistical language R, switched 
to Matlab, and finally I now teach using python.

  \item[University of Plymouth, Foundation Year Physics,
6 years] \hfill \\
I taught A-level physics to 120 Engineering students
on the foundation year. I also supervised the experimental 
laboratory sessions.

\item[University of Plymouth, Professional Experience in Mathematics
  Education / Education Project ,
1 years] \hfill \\
I marked the essays and contributed to the discussion sessions.

  \item[University of Plymouth, The Quantum Universe,
3 years] \hfill \\
This is interdisciplinary 20 credit module, which was taught
immersively over a month to first year undergraduate students.. 
I presented material in the planetarium on campus and some lectures on
particle physics and medical applications of physics.

  \item[University of Plymouth, Mathematical Programming,
1 year] \hfill \\
I developed this module and wrote the module record. Students
were taught python and Vpython. Juypter notebooks were used as well
as an online system.

  \item[University of Plymouth, Numerical and Computational Methods,
1 year] \hfill \\
I lectured basic numerical methods,
such as Simpson's rule,
 to 70 students. I also supervised
students in the computer lab, where they worked with Maple
and Matlab.

  \item[University of Plymouth, Engineering Statistics,
2 years] \hfill \\
I taught statistics to 120 final year mechanical engineering 
students. The course was assessed via course-work and a class 
test.

  \item[University of Liverpool, Special and General
Relativity,
2 years] \hfill \\
I taught a course on special and general
relativity to third year undergraduate mathematics students. 
There were 36 lectures and 12 class tutorials.

  \item[University of Liverpool, Mathematical Methods, 2 years] \hfill \\
I taught a mathematical methods course
 to 70 first year undergraduate science students.  The course
content was ``advanced calculus'' and there were 36 lectures 
with 12 class tutorials.


\item[University of Utah, Computational Physics, 2 years] \hfill \\
The course was partly an introduction to numerical
analysis, as well as an introduction to the use of the tools on a UNIX
system to solve scientific problems.  I taught the following topics:
interpolation, numerical solution of ODEs, finding roots of
equations, and numerical linear algebra.  The students wrote simple
programs in C or Fortran. When I taught the course in 1998, the
students were introduced to the C++ programming language. The maple
computer algebra package was used for about half the course.


\end{description}

\subsection{My experience in teaching small groups of undergraduates}


\begin{description}
  \item[University of Wuppertal, Computational Physics, 1 year] \hfill \\
I wrote
the homework problems for an

physics. Matlab was used for topics such as conjugate gradient
and the Ising model.

  \item[University of Glasgow, Physics 2X/2Y, 3 years] \hfill \\
I was a course tutor for the Physics 2X/2Y course
for the second year undergraduate students
in the Physics Department. I met with 4 students for 1 hour per week,
and I marked their homework.
The following topics were covered:
physics of waves, dynamics, physics of solids, thermal physics,
electricity and magnetism, nuclear and particle physics, physics of
optics, and mathematical techniques.

I supervised a 3rd and 4th year Mathematical Physics project.

\end{description}

\subsection{Teaching MSc students}

At the University of Plymouth, the MSc with the largest
number of students in the Faculty of Science and Engineering
is the data science and business analytics program. I was the 
program manager for this MSc for the year 
2021 to 2022 to cover for a staff member
on maternity leave. This year the MSc had 50 students and one
of the challenges was finding supervisors for the project module.
Typically I supervise 2 MSc projects in data science per year (and do
4 vivas), but this year 
I am upervising 5 MSc projects. Given the growth in student numbers 
I expect to supervise over 4 MSc projects per year in the future.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{My experience in project and graduate student teaching}

I have one PhD student in lattice field theory, who will graduate in
2022. I am co-supervising a second year PhD student in data science on
a project: ``machine learning methods for next generation customer
service'' in cooperation with BT research. I am the lead supervisor
for a first year PhD student in quantum computing.


I was the external examiner for PhD students
at Trinity College Dublin in 2006 and 2013,
at Cambridge University in 2018,
University of Adelaide in 2019, 
and the Universty of Swansea in 2022.


I have always worked closely with the graduate students in lattice
gauge theory at all the Universities I have worked at.  For example I
co-authored papers with 4 graduate students at Liverpool. I wrote a
paper with a graduate student at Edinburgh.  For two years I organised
a two day training workshop for postdocs and graduate students, known
as "HackLatt", on lattice QCD codes in Edinburgh. I was the originator
of the HackLatt workshops, that are now part of the culture of lattice
QCD in the UK, and have been favourably reviewed by various
international review panels.


At the University of Wuppertal, for one year, I was a tutor in
a computer lab for a course on computational 
science, as part of a masters program.


I organized the seminars in the theoretical particle physics division
at the University of Liverpool for about five years. At Glasgow I
organized the seminars for the theory group.  At the University of
Utah, I organized an internal seminar series for particle theory,
because there were so few external speakers.
I was an active
participant in the weekly particle theory postgraduate discussion
group at the University of Liverpool.
I attend a seminar for undergraduate students at the University
of Wuppertal.
I was a tutor at the BUSSTEPP summer school for first year
graduate students in theoretical particle physics for two years.



\subsection{Teaching qualifications and CPD}

I am a fellow of the Higher Education Authority, which is the standard  teaching
qualification in the UK.

During my time at University of Plymouth, I have attended external workshops on online
assessment and Physics Education Research.  In September 2005, I
attended a two day workshop in Birmingham about teaching
mathematics. In January 1999, I attended a very good lecture at
Liverpool about the art of lecturing.


\section{Teaching philosophy} 

\subsection{Undergraduate teaching}

I aim to train students in skills they
can either use in academic work or in
industry. I would also like the students to
learn about the many interesting 
topics in mathematics and physics, that they may never 
need professionally (for example the physics of black holes)
after they end their undergraduate
studies, but are part of our culture and fun
to follow in the popular press.
I realize that some students may only want
to pass the final exam with a reasonable mark,
and I am happy to help them do this.

I have tried various methods of providing brief
summaries of the material at the start of the lecture
and on-line. After marking too many exam scripts from
students who did not know that $i^2 = -1$, I provided
a checklist guide for revision (approved by two senior
Professors) for an exam, 
in addition to the exam papers and solutions of previous exams.

To try to more effectively teach calculus to first year students I
looked in books such as "how to ace calculus" and Polya's "how to
solve it" for hints. I also created a mind map for the different ways
of solving integrals. I only want to innovate in a small section of
the course, so that I could then measure the success, but without the risk
of a poor average mark in the final exam.

\subsection{Small group tutorials and projects}


I work very hard on getting the students to join in the discussions
and try problems in small tutorial groups. I try to create
a friendly and nonjudgmental environment (even when
students forget how to solve a quadratic equation).
I try to provide useful feedback on marked homework,
as soon as possible to the students. I learned a lot
about the difficulties students have learning mathematics
and physics, when I talked to them in small tutorial
groups.

I view essay and student projects as crucial to developing
problem solving skills. I try to design projects
that are simultaneously well structured, yet require
the students some initiative.

I usually try to create projects
that are a little bit "cool," but still doable by undergraduates.
For example in the project I designed for students
in a Masters course at Wuppertal, I got them to solve
the one dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. Towards the end
of the project I suggested they used a screened potential
to look at the melting of mesons in the quark gluon
plasma. I also hope that the additional motivation for the
project will help them,
if they interview for graduate studies.

\subsection{Graduate teaching}

My aim in graduate education is develop in the students:
independent problem solving skills, 
the ability to critically review material, and 
the ability to develop new areas of research. My 
involvement in the postgraduate discussion group at Liverpool
was aimed at developing the last two skills.

I want the students to use modern computer
techniques, such as scripting, C++, python, standard numerical
analysis libraries, rather than using some old legacy
FORTRAN program, because this will help them 
get jobs in industry, if they so wish.

\section{Service to the theory community}

I have refereed papers for the journals: Phys.Rev.D, Phys.Rev.Lett.,
The European Physical Journal C, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl.,
Phys. Lett. B, Journal of American Physics, Nucl.Phys. A, 
Canadian Journal of Physics,
and 
Computer Physics Communications.
I was on the local
organizing committee for the international lattice 2005 conference
held in Dublin Ireland. I was one of the three editors of the
proceedings for the lattice 2005 conference that was published in the
Proceedings of Science journal (PoS). I was on the local organizing
committee for the international conference Extreme QCD, which was held
in Plymouth 2015. I published a summary of the conference in the CERN 
courier magazine.

In 2008 I organized a collaboration meeting at Glasgow for the
European Twisted Mass lattice collaboration with 17 participants: from
France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.

I organized a two day workshop at Glasgow in April 2008 with the
title: "The nuclear physics challenge to lattice QCD"
(http://nuclear.gla.ac.uk/nuclat/). The aim of the meeting was to
open a dialog between the nuclear experimental and lattice
QCD communities. There were 65 participants at the meeting.

In January 2009, I was an invited reviewer for the midterm review of
the project: "A national computational infrastructure for Lattice
Quantum Chromodynamics" funded by the US Department of Energy 
under the SciDac-II program (Scientific Discovery 
through Advanced Computing).
I attended a two day meeting in Washington DC and wrote a report
on the status of the project.

I am a member of the Institute of Physics and I can use
CPhys MInstP after my name. I am a member of the British Computer
Society.

\section{Outreach and public understanding of science}

In 2017, 2021, and 2022 I co-organized a particle physics master 
class at Plymouth, for students at local schools  (http://math-sciences.org/masterclass .)
I have run shows on dark matter, to visiting school students,
in the planetarium on campus. I have hosted small groups
of school children on work experience and Nuffield 
schemes. They worked on particle physics or quantum computing
projects.

I organized a 1 day festival of Physics with the South West branch of
the IOP at the University of Plymouth in 2019 and 2022.
