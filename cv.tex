I taught electricity and magnetism to 120 Engineering students
on the foundation year. I also supervised the experimental 
laboratory sessions.

  \item[Plymouth University, The Quantum Universe,
2 years] \hfill \\
This is interdisciplinary 20 credit module, which is taught immersively over a month. 
I present material in the planetarium on campus and some lectures on
particle physics and medical applications of physics.

  \item[Plymouth University, Mathematical Programming,
1 year] \hfill \\
I developed this module and wrote the module record. Students
were taught python and Vpython. Juypter notebooks were used as well
as online system.

  \item[Plymouth University, Numerical and Computational Methods,
1 years] \hfill \\
I lectured basic numerical methods,
such as Simpson's rule,
 to 70 students. I also supervised
students in the computer lab, where they worked with Maple
and Matlab.

\subsection{My experience in project and graduate student teaching}


I have always worked closely with the graduate students in
lattice gauge theory at all the Universities I have worked at. 
For example I co-authored papers with 4 graduate students
at Liverpool. I have just written a paper with a graduate student
at Edinburgh.
For two years I organised a two
day training workshop for postdocs and graduate students, 
known as "HackLatt", on lattice QCD codes in
Edinburgh. I was the originator of the HackLatt workshops, that are
now part of the culture of lattice QCD in the UK, and have been favourably
reviewed by various international review panels.  


At the University of Wuppertal, for one year, I was a tutor in
a computer lab for a course on computational 
science, as part of a masters program.


I organized the seminars in the theoretical particle physics division
at the University of Liverpool for about five years. At Glasgow I
organized the seminars for the theory group.  At the University of
Utah, I organized an internal seminar series for particle theory,
because there were so few external speakers.
I was an active
participant in the weekly particle theory postgraduate discussion
group at the University of Liverpool.
I attend a seminar for undergraduate students at the University
of Wuppertal.
I was a tutor at the BUSSTEPP summer school for first year
graduate students in theoretical particle physics for two years.



\subsection{Teaching qualifications and CPD}

I am a fellow of the Higher Education Authority, which is the standard  teaching
qualification in the UK.

During my time at Plymouth University, I have attended external workshops on online
assessment and Physics Education Research.  In September 2005, I
attended a two day workshop in Birmingham about teaching
mathematics. In January 1999, I attended a very good lecture at
Liverpool about the art of lecturing.

I was the external examiner for Ph.D students
at Trinity College Dublin in 2006 and 2013.


\section{Teaching philosophy} 

\subsection{Undergraduate teaching}

I aim to train students in skills they
can either use in academic work or in
industry. I would also like the students to
learn about the many interesting 
topics in mathematics and physics, that they may never 
need professionally (for example the physics of black holes)
after they end their undergraduate
studies, but are part of our culture and fun
to follow in the popular press.
I realize that some students may only want
to pass the final exam with a reasonable mark,
and I am happy to help them do this.

I have tried various methods of providing brief
summaries of the material at the start of the lecture
and on-line. After marking too many exam scripts from
students who did not know that $i^2 = -1$, I provided
a checklist guide for revision (approved by two senior
Professors) for an exam, 
in addition to the exam papers and solutions of previous exams.

To try to more effectively teach calculus to first year students I
looked in books such as "how to ace calculus" and Polya's "how to
solve it" for hints. I also created a mind map for the different ways
of solving integrals. I only want to innovate in a small section of
the course, so that I could then measure the success, but without the risk
of a poor average mark in the final exam.

\subsection{Small group tutorials and projects}


I work very hard on getting the students to join in the discussions
and try problems in small tutorial groups. I try to create
a friendly and nonjudgmental environment (even when
students forget how to solve a quadratic equation).
I try to provide useful feedback on marked homework,
as soon as possible to the students. I learned a lot
about the difficulties students have learning mathematics
and physics, when I talked to them in small tutorial
groups.

I view essay and student projects as crucial to developing
problem solving skills. I try to design projects
that are simultaneously well structured, yet require
the students some initiative.

I usually try to create projects
that are a little bit "cool," but still doable by undergraduates.
For example in the project I designed for students
in a Masters course at Wuppertal, I got them to solve
the one dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. Towards the end
of the project I suggested they used a screened potential
to look at the melting of mesons in the quark gluon
plasma. I also hope that the additional motivation for the
project will help them,
if they interview for graduate studies.

\subsection{Graduate teaching}

My aim in graduate education is develop in the students:
independent problem solving skills, 
the ability to critically review material, and 
the ability to develop new areas of research. My 
involvement in the postgraduate discussion group at Liverpool
was aimed at developing the last two skills.

I want the students to use modern computer
techniques, such as scripting, C++, standard numerical
analysis libraries, rather than using some old legacy
FORTRAN program, because this will help them 
get jobs in industry, if they so wish.


\section{Grant writing experience} 

I am the PI for  a new lecturer grant from STFC. I am
a co-pi for a grant held by Swansea and Plymouth.

While I have been working  at Plymouth University, I have been
the PI on one grant of computer time from Dirac, and I have been
co-PI on to other grants of computer time.
In 2009, 2010, 2011
and 2012,
I wrote successful applications for computer time at the Julich
supercomputer center in Germany. I have been the PI on two projects.

In February 2007, I was involved in writing a successful proposal to
EPSRC for postdocs for computational work.  At the start of 2007 I
worked on UKQCD's bid for supercomputer resources for all lattice QCD
in the UK (Dirac-I). The grant was of the order of 6 million
pounds. The grant was approved by the funding agency, however because
of budget problems the money was only released late in 2009, after I
had left the UK.


While working in the US,
I worked with the MILC collaboration in writing grants for
substantial amounts of computer time from various NSF supercomputer
centres. In 1996, I helped to write a successful proposal for the
renewal of the MILC collaboration's status as a grand challenge
computational group from the US Department of Energy. 


\section{Service to the theory community}

I have refereed papers for the journals: Phys.Rev.D, Phys.Rev.Lett.,
The European Physical Journal C, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl.,
Phys. Lett. B, Journal of American Physics, Nucl.Phys. A, 
Canadian Journal of Physics,
and 
Computer Physics Communications.
I was on the local
organizing committee for the international lattice 2005 conference
held in Dublin Ireland. I was one of the three editors of the
proceedings for the lattice 2005 conference that was published in the
Proceedings of Science journal (PoS). I was on the local organizing
comitte for the internationl conference Extreme QCD, which was held
in Plymouth 2015. I published a summary of the conference in the CERN 
courier magazine.

In 2008 I organized a collaboration meeting at Glasgow for the
European Twisted Mass lattice collaboration with 17 participants: from
France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.

I organized a two day workshop at Glasgow in April 2008 with the
title: "The nuclear physics challenge to lattice QCD"
(http://nuclear.gla.ac.uk/nuclat/). The aim of the meeting was to
open a dialog between the nuclear experimental and lattice
QCD communities. There were 65 participants at the meeting.

In January 2009, I was an invited reviewer for the midterm review of
the project: "A national computational infrastructure for Lattice
Quantum Chromodynamics" funded by the US Department of Energy 
under the SciDac-II program (Scientific Discovery 
through Advanced Computing).
I attended a two day meeting in Washington DC and wrote a report
on the status of the project.

I am a member of the Institute of Physics and I can use
CPhys MInstP after my name.

\section{Outreach and public understanding of science}

In April 2017 I co-organized a particle physics master 
class at Plymouth, for children at local schools  (http://math-sciences.org/masterclass .)
I have run shows on dark matter, to visiting school children,
in the planetarium on campus. I have hosted small groups
of school children on work experience and Nuffield 
schemes. They worked on particle physics or quantum computing
projects.

\section{Computational and management experience}

To do large scale numerical lattice QCD calculations that are of
interest to experimentalists, requires a computational infrastructure
to support calculations on supercomputers.  While I was paid on
'physicist programmer' and 'software manager' grants, I was crucial in
developing new strategies for the software development within the 
UKQCD collaboration.
Indeed the software manager position was explicitly created for me.
For two years I managed a 'physicist programmer' at Liverpool, who
was developing code for the QCDOC computer. 

While working in the UK, I was involved in the 
QCDgrid project (http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/qcdgrid/), 
an e-science project that
uses grid technology for lattice QCD.  I ensured that the software was
usable by the average physicist. Also I wrote requirements
documents for the developers of the software.

I have a lot of experience with performing lattice QCD calculations on
both large and small computers. 
I have run benchmark jobs on the 
BluegeneP at Darsebury Laboratory, production runs on
the Bluegene/P at Argonne National Lab and Julich supercomputer centre.
I have recently run on 
clusters at Fermilab, Cambridge and Julich.

I have
used EDG grid submission tools to run jobs on a compute grid
called Scotgrid.  While I was a postdoc in the US, I ran on
super-computers at NERSC, Cornell, Oakridge, SDSC, and Pittsburgh
supercomputer centre. I have used a number of open source codes such
as the MILC code and Chroma (largely written by people at the
Jefferson lab).

I am a member of the
HPQCD collaboration (a US-Canada-UK wide collaboration),
and BMW-c (Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal).
In the past I have been a member of the UKQCD,
European Twisted Mass,
and MILC collaborations.
